# H1  A twitter based sentiment analyser that gets data and returns sentiments towards a certain topic. 

First data is rerieved from twitter API by searching the term's hashtag. This data is then passed through Python's textblob, which is a library for processing textual data. In my case I used the sentiment analysis feature of textblob. The results are then passed into a dash app.
 
As of now, the project is still in young and several updates including error handling for tweepy api, increasing accuracy of search results from the hashtags and fixing minor bugs are on the way.
